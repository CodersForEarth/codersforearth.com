  Thank you for making Nsustain better!
  These are guidelines, not rules.
  Thus, feel free to break these guidelines
  if you think that'd be better.
  However, they'll definitely help you

# 3. Pull Requests

When you request a pull request,
GitHub automatically sends an email
to the maintainers. We'll review
the pull request and merge the PR
as soon as the reviewing process is done.

If the maintainers are online,
the time it takes for a PR to be reviewed
is expected to be around an hour.
If the maintainers are offline,
however, please expect around one week.

<br>

# 4. Reporting Bugs

Preferred method of reporting bugs
is writing on the
[issues tracker](https://github.com/Nsustain/nsustain.com/issues).
However, if you don't have a GitHub
account, you can email to 
soobinrho@nsustain.com

# 5. Reporting Security Vulnerability
