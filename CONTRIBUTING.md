    Contribution Guidelines
  </b><br>
  Thank you for making Nsustain better!
  These are guidelines, not rules.
  Thus, feel free to break these guidelines
  if you think that'd be better.
  However, they'll definitely help you
  and everyone
  if you fully understand these guidelines.

# 1. Coding Conventions

If you are new to
open-source, GitHub's
[Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/)
is a good place to start.

```bash
# Go to the directory you store
# your projects in.
cd ~/projects

# Clone this repository.
git clone https://github.com/Nsustain/nsustain.com.git

# Create a new branch and
# commit all works here.
git checkout -b branch-name
```

Branch Name Do's:
- [&check;] `fix-typos`
- [&check;] `add-oauth-capability`

Branch Name Do not's:
- [&cross;] `NewBranch`
- [&cross;] `Branch2.`

<br>

## Naming Conventions

...

<br>

## HTML & CSS

...

<br>

## TypeScript

# 2. Commit Messages

We follow
[Tim Pope's guidelines on commit messages](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).

Do's:
- [&check;] `Update docs`
- [&check;] `Fix whitespaces`
- [&check;] `Fix notifications overflow`

Do not's:
- [&cross;] `updates.`
- [&cross;] `fixes.`

<br>

# 3. Pull Requests

We have two branches:
`nsustain.com/main` and 
`nsustain.com/develop`.
Make pull requests to
`develop`. All features on the
`develop` are tested
in the maintainers'
test environment first.
After all tests are passed, all commits
on `develop` will be merged to `main`.

When you make a PR,
GitHub automatically sends an email
to the maintainers.
If we are online,
we try to finish the review under a day.
If we are offline, however, 
please expect the reviewing process 
to take around one week.

<br>

# 4. Reporting Bugs

Preferred method of reporting bugs
is writing on the
[issues tracker](https://github.com/Nsustain/nsustain.com/issues).
However, if you don't have a GitHub
account, you can email to 
soobinrho@nsustain.com

<br>

# 5. Reporting Security Vulnerability

Please send an email to security@nsustain.com
