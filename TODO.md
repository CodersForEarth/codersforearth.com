# To Do List

Most TODO list items have been moved to
[GitHub Projects page](https://github.com/orgs/Nsustain/projects).

- after lunch, the first post should say,
  "hello, is anyone here?"
  and then the body says
  Hi! I'm not a regular user.
  I'm Soobin, the developer
  of this website :)
  You might be wondering if
  anybody uses this website.
  So far, we have only you
  and my team, but who knows?
  More people might start using
  our website. So, you could
  just make a post, if you happen
  to know any environmental problem
  that needs eager programmers to solve..."
  In other words, don't be embarrased
  of our new website having no user for now.
  Just own up to it and be honest about it!
  No need to create dummy posts to make it
  look populated.
  Users will appreciate us being honest.

### Feature Specifications
- Try not to do all things mediocrely, but
  do one thing the best. What does our website to?
  Help people who know the environment find
  programmers who can solve the problem.
  Help programmers who want to find a project
  that touches their heart.
