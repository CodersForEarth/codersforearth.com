***Who are we?***<br>
We are a bunch of
open-source developers
who were trying to find
an idea we can work on,
an idea that touches our heart,
an idea that's worth our time and devotion,
but we couldn't. It was such a tragedy
that - although we wanted to help -
we couldn't find a specific problem
on sustainability. They certainly exist.
We all know that there are a lot of
environmental problems that need solutions.
It was just that we didn't know
where to find them.

<br>

***What do we do?***<br>
So, we made exactly what we
wanted and needed. Nsustain
is an open-source community where
front-line environmental workers -
e.g. farmers or scientists - can
post specific problems they've noticed
in the world. Coders looking for
a meaningful project that's really worth it
now has one.

We don't try to optimize our website
such that users stay on our website
as long as possible.
No, we don't want you to
spend all day on Nsustain.
Go help the environment, write codes,
or whatever your heart desires.

The goal of our website is to help
you find a project that really touches
your heart, something that you truly find worthwhile.
We'll try to make that process as smooth and enjoyable
as possible for you, and - for your information -
we don't do anything sneaky.
We don't store suspicious cookies on your computer.
In fact, we don't even store any of your
name, email, or any other personal information.
Security is our top-most priority, and
we don't need your personal data.
All we need is your ideas and your love for the
e***n***vironment & ***sustain***ability.

<br>

***What does Nsustain mean?***<br>
An open-source community, where frontline
environmental workers can post
requests for open-source projects on the
e<b><em>n</em></b>vironment &
<b><em>sustain</em></b>ability.

<br>

***How do we keep maintaining our server?***<br>
Our website was created to be a
place for the open-source community.
As such, Nsustain
will always be an open-source project,
and we will never commercialize our website.
We do this because we genuinly wanted
to help make the e***n***vironment ***sustain***able üëç

<!--
***How did this all begin?***<br>
Soobin Rho and Mariam Wisaal started
this project for
*2022 Call for Code Global Challenge*,
which was an environmental initiative
inviting "developers and problem solvers
around the world to build and contribute
to sustainable open source technology projects."
Soobin and Mariam were college sophomores
at Augustana University at that time,
and the challenge was held for six months
from May, 2022 to October, 2022.

  <b>How we made our website</b>
</p>

Here are the exact steps we took to
make our website from ground-up,
so that you can make your own website
relatively easily if you'd like to.
This will be helpful if you'd like
to become a contributor, too.

# 1. Web programming

**Writing codes on a version-control system**<br>
Techs used:
`git`
`GitHub`

Create a `GitHub` repository because
version control ...

## Back-end

**Building the website's database**<br>
Techs used:
`Node.js`
`SQLite`

Blabla ...

```bash
# ...
...
```

## Front-end

**Building the front-end**<br>
Techs used:
`JavaScript`
`TypeScript`
`react.js`
`next.js`

Create the website ...

```bash
# ...
...
```

<br>
<br>

# 2. Containerizing the website
Techs used:
`Docker`

Make our website into a Docker image.
Why containerize and why not else.

```bash
# ...
...
```

<!--- Installing docker

Using docker compose

<br>
<br>

# 3. Deploying a container orchestration system
Techs used:
`Kubernetes`
`K3s`

Explanation on high availability.
Why K3s and not else, showing
the how and why behind
our design & architecture choices.

Install K3s.

Configure the K3s to pull our website
in the form of a Docker image.

Note: The reason why we use Kubernetes.
When our website gains more popularity,
server capability can be upscaled by
getting another VPS and then adding it
on our K3s as a worker node.

Even when we deploy a new node or when
we update our website, our website never
goes offline thanks to Kubernetes.

```bash
# ...
...
```

<br>
<br>

# 4. Getting a domain name

**Getting a domain from a domain registrar**<br>
Techs used:
`Google Domains`

Our domain name
**[[Nsustain.com](nsustain.com)]**
costs $12 per year.

**(Optional) Setting up a custom-domain email forwarding service**<br>
[Original article by Forward Email](https://forwardemail.net/en/faq#how-do-i-get-started-and-set-up-email-forwarding)<br>
Techs used:
`ForwardEmail.net`

One way of doing this would be setting up an
email server on the VPS we just got, but
we didn't need such complexity. We didn't
need to have multiple email accounts.
We could just use one email account.
All our email needs were such that just using an email
forwarding service would solve all of them.

**Setting up remote caching and DDoS protection**<br>
[Original article by Prutser Rutger](https://blog.prutser.net/2021/01/20/how-to-securely-self-host-a-website-or-web-app/)<br>
Techs used:
`Cloudflare`

It also takes care of issuing SSL certificates.

The traffic between the user and Cloudflare
is automatically SSL encrypted, but the traffic
between Cloudflare and our server needs one
extra step to be SSL encrypted -- i.e.
download the "Cloudflare-issued SSL certificate"
on their settings and install it in our server.

# 5. Getting a server

**Getting a Virtual Private Server (VPS)**<br>
Techs used:
`IBM Cloud`
`Ubuntu Server`

Get a VPS. Free trial for ...

```bash
# ...
...
```

**Running a VPS**<br>
[Original article by Joe Morgan](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-a-react-application-with-nginx-on-ubuntu-20-04)<br>
