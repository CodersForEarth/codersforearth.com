What we needed. How our website
attempts to meet our need.
Why we work hard on this website.
Why we believe in this.
Why we believe you might 
find this helpful, too.

**July 8, 2022** Our project
is still under development.
We'll ship our website by
the end of October, 2022.
So, please come back in a few months :)

To Do:
- make a Docker image of the coming soon page





# Long Term
- add descriptions on the organization setting
- add explanation for the main gist
- add tags to the `about` section on GitHub
- turn on CloudFlare's developing mode to disable caching
- make the deployment process as automated as possible
  so that the whole process can be written in scripts.
  Then, migrating the server in case of failure
  will be faster. Down-time will be minimized.
- On the last week of October, register a credit card
  to IBM to get the $200 free credit. 
  A Kubernetes cluster with 2vCPU, 4GB RAM, 25GB SSD
  for primary disk, and 100GB SSD for secondary disk
  costs $82.08 per month.
- Servers = production systems
  My laptop = test environment
- Switch back Cloudflare's SSL setting to `Full`
- Optimize the codes.

- document about the folder structure. 
  What files are where, and what & why
- include why set minimum SSL protocol to
  TLS 1.2 and drop TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1
